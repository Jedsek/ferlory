# Ferlora

My personal new generation blog, based on [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)  
(WIP, very initially.)  

![wip](./screenshots/dev_1.webp)

This is also a learning tour/challenge:  
- using `rand` in wasm32-unknown-unknown (dependencies problem)  
- making `vnode placeholder` div in dioxus  
- parsing `typst`(for mathematical formulas) && `makrdown`
- tailwind-css
- rewriting all posts in pure rust (RIIR :))  
- responsive layouts for phones, tablets, PCs  
- supportion for dark mode, compact/wide content layouts
- i18n && language switching  
- friends nets/links
- comments && chats
- notificatiion windows(like `notify-send`)
- beautiful-ui
- more...
